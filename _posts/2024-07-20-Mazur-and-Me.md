In 1977, Barry Mazur proved Ogg's conjecture, showing that the torsion subgroup of the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve over **Q** must be isomorphic to one of fifteen groups.[^1]  I can't quite remember when I first saw this statement--it might have been in a plenary talk by Álvaro Lozano-Robledo at the 2019 Union College Mathematics Conference--but I do remember being struck by just how tidy the statement was.  The classification result scratched some itch in my brain that I didn't even know I had.  It would serve as major inspiration for my [undergrad thesis](https://zporat.github.io/files/notes/mordell_curves_torsion.pdf), and propel me towards grad school.

One aspect of grad school that was undersold to me is the travel.  I knew that professional mathematicians travelled to attend conferences and give talks, but I wasn't prepared for how often these opportunities would arise as a grad student (most of them funded too)!  As I enter that last few years of my program, my travel has only increased, and I suspect that it will continue to do so.  I hope this blog will serve as a place for me to share stories from these mostly mathematical travels. 

My first travel story comes from this past year's [Arizona Winter School](https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2024/index.html).  (I originally had the idea to start this blog immediately following AWS, but, as is standard in the life of a grad student, things got busy, and I am just now getting around to actually setting it up.)  AWS is a week-long program that offers four mini-courses on a set of closely related topics in number theory and algebraic geometry.  The week is bookmarked by a series of talks by the Clay lecturer, who, for this year's topic of Abelian varieties, was Barry Mazur.  

Following his final talk, I lingered around for a bit, hoping for the chance to speak with him.  I was not the only one with this idea, and a minor line formed.  When it was my turn, I told him how important he was to my mathematical journey (something I am sure he has heard many times before).  He was as gracious and kind as all the stories I had heard; we chatted for a bit about math and about academic lineage.[^2]  

I also asked him for a picture, to which he happily agreed.  Here is the image:

I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet the man who helped set in motion this long, strange trip.  Getting a PhD in math is hard, but the chance to travel all over, learning interesting math and meeting inspiring people, is truly a wonderful adventure.

[^2]: My academic advisor, David Pollack, was a graduate student at Harvard in the '90s.  Barry Mazur was not his advisor, but rather the advisor of his brother, Robert Pollack.  I mentioned this to Professor Mazur during our conversation, and he thought for a moment before eventually concluding, "I guess that makes me your great uncle!"
