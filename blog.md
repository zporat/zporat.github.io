## A Mostly Mathematical Travelogue

Welcome to my blog!  Here, I chronicle my mostly mathematical travels as a grad student studying number theory.  

A complete archive of my blog posts can be found [here](https://zporat.github.io/archive.html).

Below is a map of the places I have been because of math!  Click the pins to see what conferences took me where, and find the blog post about that conference if I have one!
