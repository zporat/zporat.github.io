## <a name="teaching"></a> Teaching

I am teaching Graduate Pedagogy in Fall 2025.  

While at Wesleyan, I have taught [Calculus I](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005517&term=1249) and [Elementary Statistics](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005525&term=1229).  I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses and worked in the [Math Workshop](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/math/math_workshop.html).  

For additional details regarding my teaching, mentorship, and service, please see my CV: <a href="{{ site.cv_link }}" class="button" style="font-size:12px;"><i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; PDF</a>

## <a name="mentorship"></a> Mentorship

In Summer 2026, [Jeff Hatley](https://www.math.union.edu/~hatleyj/) and I will be co-leading a [Rethinking Number Theory project](https://sites.google.com/view/rethinkingnumbertheory/projects#h.e4lq3fl7mv93) as part of RNT7.  Applications will open soon! 

While at Wesleyan, I have run several mentorship projects as part of our [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).  If you are interested in proposing a topic (especially those related to number theory and algebraic geometry), please get in touch! 

In Spring 2025, I presented a mini-course on mathematical cryptology at [SWiM@Wes 2025](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/ams/swim-2025/) and served as a project assistant at [Arithmetic Geometry at UNT](https://sites.google.com/view/arithmetic-geometry-at-unt/).
