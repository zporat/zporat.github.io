**About me**

I am a physicist in soft matter and fluids at interfaces at [LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) in Grenoble (France). In 2022 I received a [MSCA](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) grant (*NanoSep*) to study the demixing of fluid mixtures by hybrid nanoporous materials, and I will soon be working at [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/).
