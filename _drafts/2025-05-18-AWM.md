My latest trip took me to the beautiful, but buggy, Madison, WI.  I was invited to speak at the 2025 [AWM Research Symposium](https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-research-symposium/) in the special session on curves and abelian varieties in characteristic p.

everyone was so friendly.  

I met someone who is 30 minutes away, it only took us flying halfway across the country to figure it out.  



In today's blog, I would like to focus on building connections at conferences.  My friend Asimina recently wrote a [blog post](https://maa.org/math-values/how-to-conference/) for the MAA in which she discusses strategies for how to successfully navigate a math conference.  I highly recommend reading it in its entirety, but one point I would like to emphasize is her discussion on how to network, and just how important it is to be social at these events.  For me, professional socialization takes a lot of energy, so thankfully, most of the networking took place in the first half of the trip, when I was still fresh.
