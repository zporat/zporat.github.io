Since my last blog, I have had the opportunity to attend three conferences!  The first was the [AWM Research Symposium](https://awm-math.org/meetings/awm-research-symposium/) in the beautiful, but buggy, Madison, WI.  I was invited to speak in the special session on curves and abelian varieties in characteristic p, where I discussed the content of my new(ish) preprint, which is joint work with Thomas Bouchet, Erik Davis, Steven Groen, and Benjamin York!  You can find the preprint here: [arXiv:2506.06457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06457).  

The second conference was the [33èmes Journées Arithmétiques](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en/conferences/ja25/) at the University of Luxembourg!  I was 


the third was [LuCaNT 2025](https://icerm.brown.edu/program/topical_workshop/tw-25-lucant), a conference on the LMFDB and computational number theory. 

everyone was so friendly.  

I met someone who is 30 minutes away, it only took us flying halfway across the country to figure it out.  



In today's blog, I would like to focus on building connections at conferences.  My friend Asimina recently wrote a [blog post](https://maa.org/math-values/how-to-conference/) for the MAA in which she discusses strategies for how to successfully navigate a math conference.  I highly recommend reading it in its entirety, but one point I would like to emphasize is her discussion on how to network, and just how important it is to be social at these events.  For me, professional socialization takes a lot of energy, so thankfully, most of the networking took place in the first half of the trip, when I was still fresh.

I saw a friend in Paris who I met at a previous math conference!  (As a bonus, I got to meet his dad who is also a mathematician, and knew one of my undergrad professors)
