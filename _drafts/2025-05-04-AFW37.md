I recently returned from a 10-day trip to Denton, TX.  The first half of the trip was spent attending and speaking at the [37th Automorphic Forms Workshop](http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/pastworkshops/2025/index.html).  In the latter half, I served as a project assistant for [Arithmetic Geometry at UNT](https://sites.google.com/view/arithmetic-geometry-at-unt/).  It was a *long* trip, but along the way I made a lot of friends!  


My friend Asimina wrote a [blog post](https://maa.org/math-values/how-to-conference/) for the MAA in which she discusses strategies for how to successfully navigate a math conference.  I highly recommend reading it in its entirety, but 







I will leave you with an image of a beautiful Texas sunset.
