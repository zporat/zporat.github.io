## <a name="about"></a> About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/).  My advisor is [David Pollack](https://dpollack.web.wesleyan.edu/).

My research interests lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  I particularly enjoy the computational aspects of these subjects.  Currently, I am studying automorphic forms for congruence subgroups of SL(3,&nbsp;**Z**).  

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from [Union College](https://www.union.edu/mathematics).  Outside of math, I enjoy [bouldering](https://zporat.github.io/files/pictures/bouldering.jpg) and playing trumpet.  I also occasionally [blog](https://zporat.github.io/blog.html) about my travels as a grad student.

Here is a copy of my CV, last updated in June 2025: <a href="{{ site.cv_link }}" class="button" style="font-size:12px;"><i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; PDF</a>

## <a name="teaching"></a> Teaching

I am not teaching in Spring 2025.  I presented a mini-course on mathematical cryptology at [SWiM@Wes 2025](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/ams/swim-2025/). I also served as a project assistant at [Arithmetic Geometry at UNT](https://sites.google.com/view/arithmetic-geometry-at-unt/).

While at Wesleyan, I have taught [Calculus I](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005517&term=1249) and [Elementary Statistics](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005525&term=1229).  I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses and worked in the [Math Workshop](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/math/math_workshop.html). 

Additionally, I have run several mentorship projects as part of Wesleyan's [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).

## <a name="service"></a> Service

I am currently one of the organizers of our [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).  

I previously served as President (Fall 2023--Spring 2025) and Vice President (Fall 2021--Spring 2023) of Wesleyan's [AMS Graduate Student Chapter](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/ams/).  Additionally, from Spring 2022 through Fall 2023, I was a co-organizer of the departmental [Graduate Student Seminar](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/gss/).
