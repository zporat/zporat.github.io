## <a name="about"></a> About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at Wesleyan University.  My advisor is David Pollack.

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Union College.  For more information, my CV can be found below.

Outside of math, I enjoy rock climbing and playing trumpet.
