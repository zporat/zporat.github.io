## <a name="about"></a> About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/).  My advisor is [David Pollack](https://dpollack.web.wesleyan.edu/).

My research interests lie in number theory.  In particular, I study automorphic forms on congruence subgroups of SL(3, **Z**).

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from [Union College](https://www.union.edu/mathematics).  Outside of math, I enjoy rock climbing and playing trumpet.

Here is a copy of my CV, last updated in March 2023: [[PDF](site.cv_link)]

## Teaching

I am not teaching in Fall 2023.

While at Wesleyan, I have taught [Elementary Statistics](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005525&term=1229).  I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses and worked in the Math Workshop. 

Additionally, I have run several mentorship projects as part of Wesleyan's [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).
