## About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at Wesleyan University.  My advisor is David Pollack.

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Union College.  For more information, my CV can be found below.

Outside of math, I enjoy rock climbing and playing trumpet. 

## Research 

My research interests lie in number theory and algebraic geometry. In particular, I study automorphic forms of SL3.
