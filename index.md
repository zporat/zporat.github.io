## <a name="about"></a> About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at Wesleyan University.  My advisor is David Pollack.

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Union College.  For more information, here is a copy of my CV, last updated in March 2023 [[**PDF**](site.cv_link)].

Outside of math, I enjoy rock climbing and playing trumpet.

## Research 

My research interests lie in number theory and algebraic geometry.  In particular, I study automorphic forms of SL(3,&nbsp**Z**).
