## <a name="about"></a> About Me

My name is Zachary (Zack) Porat.  I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics at [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/).  My advisor is [David Pollack](https://dpollack.web.wesleyan.edu/).

My research interests lie in number theory.  In particular, I study automorphic forms for congruence subgroups of SL(3, **Z**).

Before Wesleyan, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from [Union College](https://www.union.edu/mathematics).  Outside of math, I enjoy [bouldering](https://zporat.github.io/files/pictures/bouldering.jpg) and playing trumpet.

Here is a copy of my CV, last updated in May 2024: <a href="{{ site.cv_link }}" class="button" style="font-size:16px;">PDF</a>

## Teaching

I am not teaching in Spring 2024.

While at Wesleyan, I have taught [Elementary Statistics](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&crse=005525&term=1229).  I have also been a Teaching Assistant for several courses and worked in the [Math Workshop](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/math/math_workshop.html). 

Additionally, I have run several mentorship projects as part of Wesleyan's [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).

## Service

I am currently the President of Wesleyan's [AMS Graduate Student Chapter](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/ams/).  I am also one of the organizers of our [Directed Reading Program](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/drp/).

Additionally, from Spring 2022 through Fall 2023, I was a co-organizer of the departmental [Graduate Student Seminar](https://mathcs-graduate.wescreates.wesleyan.edu/gss/).
