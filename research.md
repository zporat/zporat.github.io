## <a name="about"></a> Research

My research interests lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry.  I particularly enjoy the interplay between theory and computation.  My work centers around developing theoretical insights and using these insights to improve computational algorithms.  

Currently, I am studying automorphic forms for congruence subgroups of SL(3,&nbsp;**Z**).  I am also interested in arithmetic statistics, especially in relation to algebraic curves and abelian varieties.
